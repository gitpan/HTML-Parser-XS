HTML-Parser-XS
--------------

This is currently an alpha release of a new XS based implementation of
HTML::Parser.  This new implementation speeds up things about 4 times
if you use the direct callbacks instead of method callbacks.  For
method callbacks we currently have a speedup of about 30%.




HTML-Parser
-----------

This is a collection of modules that parse HTML text documents. These
modules used to be part of the libwww-perl distribution, but are now
unbundled in order to facilitate a separate development track.  Bug
reports and discussions about these modules can still be sent to the
<libwww@perl.org> mailing list.  Remember to also take a look at the
HTML-Tree module collection that create and extract information from
HTML syntax trees.

The modules present in this collection are:

  HTML::Parser - The parser base class.  It receives arbitrary sized
        chunks of the HTML text and will tokenize it by calling
        appropriate methods on itself.

  HTML::Entities - Provides functions to encode and decode text with
        embedded HTML &lt;entities&gt;.

  HTML::Filter - An HTML::Parser subclass that filters HTML text. You
        will need to make a subclass if you want it to do more than
        cat(1).

  HTML::HeadParser - A lightweight HTML::Parser subclass that extract
        information from the <HEAD> section of an HTML document.

  HTML::LinkExtor - An HTML::Parser subclass that extract links from
        an HTML document.

  HTML::TokeParser - An alternative interface to the basic parser
        that does not require subclassing.  Most simple parsing needs
        are probably best attacked with this module.



PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.004 or better.  If you intend to use the HTML::HeadParser you need to
have the libwww-perl distribution installed.
