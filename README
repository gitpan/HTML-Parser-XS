HTML-Parser-XS
--------------

This is a beta release of a new XS based implementation of
HTML::Parser.  It should be completely compatible with the old
HTML-Parser-2.xx, but improves parsing speed (4-40x) and adds
several new features.




HTML-Parser
-----------

This is a collection of modules that parse and extract information
from HTML documents.  Bug reports and discussions about these modules
can be sent to the <libwww@perl.org> mailing list.  Remember to
look at the HTML-Tree package that creates and extracts information from
HTML syntax trees.

The modules present in this collection are:

  HTML::Parser - The parser base class.  It receives arbitrary sized
        chunks of the HTML text, recognizes markup elements, and
        separates them from the plain text.  As different kinds of markup
        and text are recognized, the corresponding event handlers are
        invoked.

  HTML::Entities - Provides functions to encode and decode text with
        embedded HTML &lt;entities&gt;.

  HTML::Filter - An HTML::Parser subclass that filters HTML text. You
        will need to make a subclass if you want it to do more than
        cat(1).  HTML::Filter is depreciated.

  HTML::HeadParser - A lightweight HTML::Parser subclass that extracts
        information from the <HEAD> section of an HTML document.

  HTML::LinkExtor - An HTML::Parser subclass that extracts links from
        an HTML document.

  HTML::TokeParser - An alternative interface to the basic parser
        that does not require event driven programming.  Most simple
        parsing needs are probably best attacked with this module.



PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.004 or better.  If you intend to use the HTML::HeadParser you need to
have libwww-perl installed.
