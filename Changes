1999-11-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_07

   Entities in attribute values are now always expanded.

   If you set the $p->decode_text_entities to a true value, then
   you don't have to decode the text yourself.

   In xml_mode we don't report empty element tags as a start tag
   with an extra parameter any more.  Instead we generate an artificial
   end tag.

   'xml_mode' now implies 'keep_case'.

   The parser now keeps its own copy of the bool_attr_value value.

   Avoid memory leak for text callbacks

   Avoid using ERROR as a goto label.

   Introduced common internal accessor function for all boolean parser
   attributes.

   Tweaks to make Parser.xs compile under perl5.004.



1999-11-08   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_06

   Internal fast decode_entities().   By using it we are able to make
   the HTML::Entities::decode funtion 6 times faster than the old one
   implemented in pure perl.

   $p->bool_attr_value() can be set to influence the value that
   boolean attributes will be assigned.  The default is to assign
   a value identical to the attribute name.

   Process instructions are reported as "PI" in @accum
   
   $p->xml_mode(1) modify how processing instructions are terminated
   and allow "/>" in the end of start tags.

   Turn off optimizations when compiling with gcc on Solaris.  Avoid
   what we believe to be a compiler bug.  Should probably figure out
   which version of gcc have this bug.

   Release 2.99_05

   The previous release did not even compile.  I forgot to try 'make test'
   before uploading.



1999-11-05   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_04

   Generalized <XMP>-support to cover all literal parsing.  Currently
   activated for <script>, <style>, <xmp> and <plaintext>.



1999-11-05   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_03

   <XMP>-support.

   Allow ":" in tag and attribute names

   Include rest of the HTML::* files from the old HTML::Parser
   packages.  This should make testing easier.



1999-11-04   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_02

   Implemented keep_case() option.  If this attribute is true, then
   we don't lowercase tag and attribute names.

   Implemented accum() that takes an array reference.  Tokens are
   pushed onto this array instead of callbacks.

   Implemented strict_comment().



1999-11-03   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_01

   Baseline of XS implementation



1999-11-05   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.25

   Allow ":" in attribute names as a workaround for Microsoft Excel
   2000 which generates such files.

   Make depreciate warning if netscape_buggy_comment() method is
   used.  The method to use in strict_comment().

   Avoid duplication of parse_file() method in HTML::HeadParser.



1999-10-29   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.24

   $p->parse_file() will not close a handle passed to it any more.
   If passed a filename that can't be opened it will return undef
   instead of raising an exception, and strings like "*STDIN" are not
   treated as globs any more.

   HTML::LinkExtor knowns about background attribute of <tables>.
   Patch by Clinton Wong <clintdw@netcom.com>

   HTML::TokeParser will parse large inline strings much faster now.
   The string holding the document must not be changed during parsing.



1999-06-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.23

   Documentation updates.



1998-12-18   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.22

   Protect HTML::HeadParser from evil $SIG{__DIE__} hooks.



1998-11-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.21

   HTML::TokeParser can now parse strings directly and does the
   right thing if you pass it a GLOB.  Based on patch by
   Sami Itkonen <si@iki.fi>.

   HTML::Parser now allow space before and after "--" in Netscape
   comments.  Patch by Peter Orbaek <poe@daimi.au.dk>.



1998-07-08   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.20

   Added HTML::TokeParser.  Check it out!



1998-07-07   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.19

   Don't end a text chunk with space when we try to avoid breaking up
   words.



1998-06-22   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.18

   HTML::HeadParser->parse_file will now stop parsing when the
   <body> starts as it should.

   HTML::LinkExtor more easily subclassable by introducing the
   $self->_found_link method.



1998-04-28   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.17

   Never split words (a sequence of non-space) between two invocations
   of $self->text.  This is just a simplification of the code that tried
   not to break entities.
   
   HTML::Parser->parse_file now use smaller chunks as already
   suggested by the HTML::Parser documentation.



1998-04-02   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.16
   
   The HTML::Parser could some times break hex entites (like &#xFFFF;)
   in the middle.

   Removed remaining forced dependencies on libwww-perl modules.  It
   means that all tests should now pass, even if libwww-perl was not
   installed previously.

   More tests.



1998-04-01   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.14, HTML::* modules unbundled from libwww-perl-5.22.
