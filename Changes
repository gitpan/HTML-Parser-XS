1999-11-08   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_06

   Internal fast decode_entities().   By using it we are able to make
   the HTML::Entities::decode funtion 6 times faster than the old one
   implemented in pure perl.

   $p->bool_attr_value() can be set to influence the value that
   boolean attributes will be assigned.  The default is to assign
   a value identical to the attribute name.

   Process instructions are reported as "PI" in @accum
   
   $p->xml_mode(1) modify how processing instructions are terminated
   and allow "/>" in the end of start tags.

   Turn off optimizations when compiling with gcc on Solaris.  Avoid
   what we believe to be a compiler bug.  Should probably figure out
   which version of gcc have this bug.

   Release 2.99_04

   Generalized <XMP>-support to cover all literal parsing.  Currently

   Release 2.99_03

   <XMP>-support.

   Allow ":" in tag and attribute names

   Include rest of the HTML::* files from the old HTML::Parser
   packages.  This should make testing easier.



1999-11-04   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 2.99_02

   Implemented keep_case() option.  If this attribute is true, then
   we don't lowercase tag and attribute names.

   Implemented accum() that takes an array reference.  Tokens are
   pushed onto this array instead of callbacks.

   Implemented strict_comment().
